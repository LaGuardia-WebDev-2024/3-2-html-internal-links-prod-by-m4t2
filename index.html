      The <strong>kangaroo</strong> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae
      (macropods, meaning 'large foot'). In common use the term is used to
      describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the
      genus Macropus, red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo
      and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia, and one
      genus, the tree-kangaroo, is also found in Papua New Guinea.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping,
      a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials,
      female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete
      postnatal development.
    </p>

    <p>
      Larger kangaroos have adapted much better than smaller macropods to land
      clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the
      Australian landscape by humans. Many of the smaller species are rare and
      endangered, whilst the larger kangaroos are relatively plentiful.

    <h3 id="locomotion">Locomotion</h3>

    <p>
      A Tasmanian forester (eastern grey) kangaroo in motion. Kangaroos are the
      only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The
      comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km/h (13–16
      mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained over short
      distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly 2
      km (1.2 mi). This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved
      because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food
      and water, rather than the need to escape predators. At slow speeds, it
      employs pentapedal locomotion, using its tail to form a tripod with its
      two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward. Kangaroos are adept
      swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator. If
      pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the
      predator underwater so as to drown it.

    <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>

    <p>
      Kangaroos have chambered stomachs similar to those of cattle and sheep.
      They regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then
      swallow it again for final digestion. Different species of kangaroos have
      different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey
      kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses,
      whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant
      amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also
      consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular,
      usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights
      and mornings moving about and feeding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized
      teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its
      molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are
      not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the
      kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars
      move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by
      new teeth that grow in the back. This process is known as polyphyodonty
      and amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.
